# Customer Segmentation and Profiling Project
In this project, I segmented customer data to uncover insights that could inform targeted marking strategies and improve customer retention. Using R (CART and K-means), I focused on customer tenure while also analyzing key demographic and behavioral variables. I used Tableau Prep to clean and prepare the data, and Tableau Desktop to create visualizations that highlighted signficant patterns and trends. The segmentation revealed distinct customer groups that could be targeted with personalized strategies to enhance engagement and retention.
